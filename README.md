# GoldtreePy
A python port of XorTroll's [Goldtree](https://github.com/XorTroll/Goldleaf/tree/master/Goldtree)


To use, open **USB Installaton** in Goldleaf, then do `sudo ./Goldtree.py [nsp file]` on your computer. It requires [pyusb](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb). It has no GUI, and I feel like most people who will be using this won't care about the lack of a GUI, but if there's enough demand I can figure out how to implement it.
